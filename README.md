## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sreepathipraveena/Weather-API.git
cd Weather-API
2. Open the project

Simply open index.html in your browser.

Or, if you’re using VS Code, install the Live Server extension and run the app.

🔑 API Key Setup

Create a free account at OpenWeatherMap
.

Generate your API Key.

In your project folder, create a file named config.js (not uploaded to GitHub).

Add your API key inside config.js:

const API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";


Import it in script.js.

⚠️ Important: Do not share or commit your API key publicly (GitHub will flag it as a security risk).

⭐ If you like this project, don’t forget to star the repo!

👉 I suggest you also **add screenshots** of your Weather App (maybe `home.png`, `search.png`) and place them in a `screenshots/` folder in your repo. That will make your README look much more attractive.  

Would you like me to also **create the `.gitignore` file** for your project (so API key won’t leak again)?
